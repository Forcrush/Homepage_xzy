			<h1>* 14th Undergraduate Scientific and Technological Innovation Project, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 2017-'The effect of modified high-density mental particles on performance of enhanced foam insulation material'</h1>
			<p>In former research, our team has found that addition of high-density mental particles(HMP) can improve the performance of insulation materials. This project aims to study how HMP can be modified to better insulate sound waves. We mixed HMP and titanate coupler to make modified HMP(M-HMP) and then add it to insulation material. The crystal behaviour, microstructure, sound insulation and mechanical peoperties were investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, acoustic impedence tube respectively.</p>
			<h1>* Energy and Environmental Sustainability (E2S2) Project for megacities, National University of Singapore, 2018-'Monitor of emerging organic pollutants in Singapore rain and rivers'</h1>
			<p>In my duration of NUS, I volunteered to work in E2S2 laboratory and helped researchers do some preparation work. This project aims to moniter the existence of emerging organic pollutants（EOPs） in Singapore rain and rivers, so the transport of EOPs can be better studied. Specifically, water samples were collected and filtrated, Solid-Phase Extraction was used to concentrate targeted chemicals and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry was used to detect and quantify EOPs in samples.</p>
			<h1>* Subproject of national water restoration program, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 2018-'Adsorption of nitrogen and phophorous in water using biochar'</h2>
			<p>This project is a practical project funded by the government, it aims to reduce the centigrade of nitrate and phosphate in rivers to avoid eutrophication, and production of biochar from sediment can alleviate the pressure of massive sludge each year. Sediment was collected in Wuxi city in China and then went through pyrolysis to make biochar. And then we conducted adsorption experiment to test biochar's ability to remove nitrate and phosphate in water. Infrared Spectroscopy, Inductively Coupled Plasma, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance tests and X-rays Diffraction tests were used to explain the theory of adsorption during the process.</p>
			<h1>* Undergraduate participation in research program, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, IN PROGRESS-'Transformation of nitrogen and phosphorous during pyrolysis</h1>
			<p>This project studies factors influencing transformation of nitrogen and phophorous and evolution during pyrolysis. X-ray Diffraction and X-ray Absortion Near Edge Strcture will be conducted to explain this process in detial.</p>
